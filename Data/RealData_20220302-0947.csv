Broadly, open research (also called ‘open scholarship’ or, in some disciplines, ‘open science’) refers to efforts to ensure that different elements of the research process are transparent and accessible. The aim of this survey is to assess the views of Oxford researchers on open research practices, related training needs and provision, and recruitment criteria.



The survey is administered by Reproducible Research Oxford. It is aimed at researchers in any role and at any career stage (including academics, research staff and fellows, research support staff, and postgraduate research students), working in any field of research across the collegiate University. The target audience includes researchers based in all Divisions of the University (Humanities; Mathematical, Physical, and Life Sciences; Medical Sciences; Social Sciences; Gardens, Libraries and Museums; Continuing Education) and/or in the Colleges.



Survey responses will inform the implementation of open research practices and responsible research assessment at Oxford. Therefore, it is important for all views to be represented. You are encouraged to take part whether or not you are aware of open research practices, and whether or not you deem them relevant or necessary for your field of research. Your participation will ensure that related guidance developed at departmental and/or University level is appropriate for your discipline.



As a ‘thank you’ for taking part, we will donate £1 to the University’s Graduate Student Support Fund for each survey submitted (up to a total of £1,500). Additionally, after completing the survey you can enter a raffle for a chance to win one of five £50 gift cards from Bookshop.org, an online service in support of local bookshops (optional; details below).



Between January and March 2021 we administered the survey to postgraduate research students. Following that round, we donated £500 to the University’s Coronavirus Hardship Fund, and we awarded five £50 Blackwell’s gift cards to respondents who entered the raffle. The results have been used to inform the work of Reproducible Research Oxford and related activities in the University, and they will be compared to the results from the current round. If you already took part in the survey, thank you for your contribution! You are welcome to take part again.



Survey procedure and data protection

Participation in the survey is voluntary. The survey comprises 12 questions, and we estimate that it will take under 20 minutes to complete. You can complete part of the survey and resume it on this device, using the same browser, within seven days. The survey will be active until 1 March 2022.



You can choose to exit the survey at any time. Additionally, you can explicitly request to withdraw your responses while the survey is active, whether you have completed it in full or only in part. Once you agree to participate, you will be provided with a respondent ID for this purpose (details below).



All responses will be anonymous and they will be used exclusively for academic purposes. Non-identifiable information will be shared openly in appropriate repositories, and relevant findings will be disseminated via the Reproducible Research Oxford website.



Once you complete the survey, you will be given access to a separate secure form. If you wish to enter the raffle for the Bookshop.org’s gift cards (optional), you can provide your contact details in this form. The information provided will not be linked to your survey responses in any way. It will be stored securely and permanently deleted once all raffle prizes are accepted. We will not use the information for any other purpose.



Reproducible Research Oxford is supported by an interdivisional award from the John Fell Fund (award number: 0007132). Ethical review of all procedures linked to the survey was conducted following Central University Research Ethics Committee (CUREC) guidance (approval number: SAME_C1A_20_105; contact: hod@anthro.ox.ac.uk), and in line with University guidance on the requirement of data protection law.

Please indicate the overall duration of your research experience (number of years rounded to the nearest 0.5 year).,"Page 3 | Open research practices 


This section focuses on open research. Definitions of relevant terms vary across fields of research and contexts. Therefore, we provide the following standardised entries for you to refer to throughout the remainder of the survey.

 

 
  
   
   
    Open Access publications An article, book chapter, book, or other scholarly work that is released with unrestricted access (i.e. available to the public to view online, or download, without registration, payment, or approval). This includes all forms of open access, such as 'green' (i.e. the accepted version of the work, after peer review, is shared by the author(s) in a repository), and 'gold' (i.e. the version processed by the publisher is released openly on the publisher’s system upon publication). 
    Repository A service dedicated to facilitating the preservation and sharing of research content, including digital repositories (for digital collections, data, code, etc.) and physical repositories (for collections, archives, reagents, specimens, etc.). The service may be operated by universities, governments, or private organizations, and it can be domain-agnostic or discipline-specific. Access to such repositories may be open or controlled (e.g. requiring registration, payment, or approval). Personal web-pages or other ad hoc methods of storing and sharing research content are not included.
    Data Any information underpinning a piece of research. The information can be qualitative (e.g. source, archive, representation of art, artefact) and/or quantitative (e.g. measurements, machine output, simulation results). The data can be raw (i.e. as collected), cleaned (i.e. corrected for errors), or prepared/processed (e.g. transformed into a different format for analysis, or anonymized for sharing). 
    Code Custom software developed by researchers specifically for the purpose of conducting a piece of research (e.g. a computer program to extract, clean, or analyse data, or to generate simulation results), or to build components of a research data infrastructure (e.g. a data repository). 
    Materials Any element of the research process that can be coded digitally or shared physically (e.g. protocols, survey questions, instructions, intervention materials, videos of the study procedure, specimens, reagents, samples, and other items used to collect data and/or conduct the research).
    Preprints An article, book chapter, book, or other scholarly work that is deposited in a repository ahead of peer review. Equivalent terms used in some disciplines are 'working papers' and 'unpublished manuscripts'.
    Preregistration The practice by which researchers specify elements of the planned work in a dedicated registry before observing the outcomes of the work. Examples include description of the planned approach for a qualitative study, and the data analysis plan for a quantitative study (i.e. a ’pre-analysis plan’, which can be submitted either before the start of data collection or for previously collected datasets, before the start of data analysis). 
    Registered report A journal article format in which research question(s) and methodology are peer-reviewed before the work is conducted. A submission may be provisionally accepted for publication following peer-review, and eventually published if the authors follow through with the methodology specified in the accepted version (deviations from the registered plan are allowed, but they must be explicitly justified and noted as such). Acceptance of the article to the journal is therefore independent of the results obtained. 
   
   
  
 




4. Which of the following research practices are you aware of, and which do you have experience with?
‘Aware only’ indicates that it is applicable to your discipline, but you do not have direct experience with it. ‘Accessing/using only’ refers to resources made available by others. ‘Practicing myself’ relates to implementation of the practice in your own research (in addition to, or instead of, accessing/using resources made available by others). - Open Access publication","Page 3 | Open research practices

    Materials Any element of the research process that can be coded digitally or shared physically (e.g. protocols, survey questions, instructions, intervention materials, videos of the study procedure, specimens, reagents, samples, and other items used to collect data and/or conduct the research).
    Preprints An article, book chapter, book, or other scholarly work that is deposited in a repository ahead of peer review. Equivalent terms used in some disciplines are 'working papers' and 'unpublished manuscripts'.
    Preregistration The practice by which researchers specify elements of the planned work in a dedicated registry before observing the outcomes of the work. Examples include description of the planned approach for a qualitative study, and the data analysis plan for a quantitative study (i.e. a ’pre-analysis plan’, which can be submitted either before the start of data collection or for previously collected datasets, before the start of data analysis). 
    Registered report A journal article format in which research question(s) and methodology are peer-reviewed before the work is conducted. A submission may be provisionally accepted for publication following peer-review, and eventually published if the authors follow through with the methodology specified in the accepted version (deviations from the registered plan are allowed, but they must be explicitly justified and noted as such). Acceptance of the article to the journal is therefore independent of the results obtained. 
   
   
  
 




4. Which of the following research practices are you aware of, and which do you have experience with?
‘Aware only’ indicates that it is applicable to your discipline, but you do not have direct experience with it. ‘Accessing/using only’ refers to resources made available by others. ‘Practicing myself’ relates to implementation of the practice in your own research (in addition to, or instead of, accessing/using resources made available by others). - Preregistration","Page 3 | Open research practices 


This section focuses on open research. Definitions of relevant terms vary across fields of research and contexts. Therefore, we provide the following standardised entries for you to refer to throughout the remainder of the survey.

 

 
  
   
   
    Open Access publications An article, book chapter, book, or other scholarly work that is released with unrestricted access (i.e. available to the public to view online, or download, without registration, payment, or approval). This includes all forms of open access, such as 'green' (i.e. the accepted version of the work, after peer review, is shared by the author(s) in a repository), and 'gold' (i.e. the version processed by the publisher is released openly on the publisher’s system upon publication). 
    Repository A service dedicated to facilitating the preservation and sharing of research content, including digital repositories (for digital collections, data, code, etc.) and physical repositories (for collections, archives, reagents, specimens, etc.). The service may be operated by universities, governments, or private organizations, and it can be domain-agnostic or discipline-specific. Access to such repositories may be open or controlled (e.g. requiring registration, payment, or approval). Personal web-pages or other ad hoc methods of storing and sharing research content are not included.
    Data Any information underpinning a piece of research. The information can be qualitative (e.g. source, archive, representation of art, artefact) and/or quantitative (e.g. measurements, machine output, simulation results). The data can be raw (i.e. as collected), cleaned (i.e. corrected for errors), or prepared/processed (e.g. transformed into a different format for analysis, or anonymized for sharing). 
    Code Custom software developed by researchers specifically for the purpose of conducting a piece of research (e.g. a computer program to extract, clean, or analyse data, or to generate simulation results), or to build components of a research data infrastructure (e.g. a data repository). 
    Materials Any element of the research process that can be coded digitally or shared physically (e.g. protocols, survey questions, instructions, intervention materials, videos of the study procedure, specimens, reagents, samples, and other items used to collect data and/or conduct the research).
    Preprints An article, book chapter, book, or other scholarly work that is deposited in a repository ahead of peer review. Equivalent terms used in some disciplines are 'working papers' and 'unpublished manuscripts'.

   Different factors may contribute to the adoption of open research practices, including:

   
    infrastructure, i.e. tools, resources, and/or services that enable implementation of the practice (e.g. repositories for digital or physical storage; registries for preregistration; publishing platforms or outlets) and of relevant community standards (e.g. guidelines relating to citation of data and metadata; ethical and legal guidelines for sharing sensitive data); 
    training, i.e the acquisition of knowledge and/or skills needed to implement the practice; 
    norms, i.e. widespread attitudes and behaviours that support and/or encourage the practice (e.g. the perception that the field is aware of the practice and in favour of implementation; interest from early-career researchers; support from supervisors, mentors);
    incentives, i.e. resources and/or mechanisms that reward the practice (e.g. dedicated funding, awards; institutional recognition); 
    policy, i.e. a requirement to implement the practice by relevant stakeholders (e.g. institutions, funders, publishers).
   

   
   Time may be perceived as an additional factor contributing to adoption of a practice. Rather, we consider availability of time, or lack thereof, as a consequence of the factors listed above. For example, a researcher may choose to invest the time required to adopt a practice depending on:

   
    the availability of infrastructure or training, which facilitate implementation;
    the existence of norms in the community, which mitigate the burden on the researcher;
    the presence of incentives, or policy, which reward and/or mandate the practice in the researcher’s field or institution.

    training, i.e the acquisition of knowledge and/or skills needed to implement the practice; 
    norms, i.e. widespread attitudes and behaviours that support and/or encourage the practice (e.g. the perception that the field is aware of the practice and in favour of implementation; interest from early-career researchers; support from supervisors, mentors);
    incentives, i.e. resources and/or mechanisms that reward the practice (e.g. dedicated funding, awards; institutional recognition); 
    policy, i.e. a requirement to implement the practice by relevant stakeholders (e.g. institutions, funders, publishers).
   

   
   Time may be perceived as an additional factor contributing to adoption of a practice. Rather, we consider availability of time, or lack thereof, as a consequence of the factors listed above. For example, a researcher may choose to invest the time required to adopt a practice depending on:

   
    the availability of infrastructure or training, which facilitate implementation;
    the existence of norms in the community, which mitigate the burden on the researcher;
    the presence of incentives, or policy, which reward and/or mandate the practice in the researcher’s field or institution.

   Different factors may contribute to the adoption of open research practices, including:

   
    infrastructure, i.e. tools, resources, and/or services that enable implementation of the practice (e.g. repositories for digital or physical storage; registries for preregistration; publishing platforms or outlets) and of relevant community standards (e.g. guidelines relating to citation of data and metadata; ethical and legal guidelines for sharing sensitive data); 
    training, i.e the acquisition of knowledge and/or skills needed to implement the practice; 
    norms, i.e. widespread attitudes and behaviours that support and/or encourage the practice (e.g. the perception that the field is aware of the practice and in favour of implementation; interest from early-career researchers; support from supervisors, mentors);
    incentives, i.e. resources and/or mechanisms that reward the practice (e.g. dedicated funding, awards; institutional recognition); 
    policy, i.e. a requirement to implement the practice by relevant stakeholders (e.g. institutions, funders, publishers).
   

   
   Time may be perceived as an additional factor contributing to adoption of a practice. Rather, we consider availability of time, or lack thereof, as a consequence of the factors listed above. For example, a researcher may choose to invest the time required to adopt a practice depending on:

   
    the availability of infrastructure or training, which facilitate implementation;
    the existence of norms in the community, which mitigate the burden on the researcher;
    the presence of incentives, or policy, which reward and/or mandate the practice in the researcher’s field or institution.

    incentives, i.e. resources and/or mechanisms that reward the practice (e.g. dedicated funding, awards; institutional recognition); 
    policy, i.e. a requirement to implement the practice by relevant stakeholders (e.g. institutions, funders, publishers).
   

   
   Time may be perceived as an additional factor contributing to adoption of a practice. Rather, we consider availability of time, or lack thereof, as a consequence of the factors listed above. For example, a researcher may choose to invest the time required to adopt a practice depending on:

   
    the availability of infrastructure or training, which facilitate implementation;
    the existence of norms in the community, which mitigate the burden on the researcher;
    the presence of incentives, or policy, which reward and/or mandate the practice in the researcher’s field or institution.

The general lack of funding for publishing and increasing proportion of journals turning into complete open access (ie forcing all submission to be published open access) is hugely detrimental to resource-limited researchers, from all sorts of settings but most prominently from LMICs. This has been a great barrier to collaboration as OA funding from places like Oxford only funds research where Oxford researchers have a leading role, but at the same time, all of our work has to be published OA as a funder's requirement.

Additionally the funds are not accessible for papers published after the project has finished, and for most of my work papers can come out up to 4 or 5 years after a funded project has officially finished. Some funders in my area e.g. Leverhulme Trust also do not allow funds to be used to pay for open access. I do put all my papers on ResearchGate and similar venues but a few publishers are very assiduous in issuing take down notices for material still under embargo. ",,,,,,,Yes,,Not sure,Not sure,Yes,Yes,Yes,"It depends on what sort of OA is adopted. If it is gold OA then it will exclude people funded by groups that do not allow APCs and also colleagues in other countries where OA is not supported. This includes LMICs but I have also spoken to colleagues in France who refuse or are not permitted to pay APCs out of grants that come from public money.  Until the power of the big publishing companies is broken there will not be a fair and equitable academic publishing model. Ideally we, or our universities, should own the copyright in our formatted material and journals should be reduced to hosting platforms with no claim on intellectual property produced by academics. ",,,,"I am just not convinced that preprints are meaningful for social science research. Most papers that I review go through significant revisions as they go from submission to publication. Reviewers and editors may also pick up on significant ethical issues related to use of qualitative data from, for example, vulnerable populations in the review processes. It feels very much like this is a methodology designed for physical and life sciences research that is not relevant or helpful for the humanities and social sciences","I am not sure why we would do this, or who it would benefit. I would see it mainly as a waste of time unless it was part of the evaluation process of applying for funding (i.e. unless it added a new open step to applying for grants) but even then the details of 'how' a piece of research will be conducted are not usually worked out until after funding has been secured. Also a lot of interpretation of qualitative data is inductive and only becomes clear once the researcher is actually working with the data. It is iterative and cumulative not a pre-determined deductive set of criteria.","Qualitative research differs in important ways from a natural sciences experiment and modulation of the research questions, protocols etc is commonplace and useful in qualitative interviews, focus groups etc so I would not welcome any approach which flags these as 'deviations' since it is hard enough to convince natural and life scientists of the validity of interpretive qualitative social science. Again I think this is a case of an approach to openness developed for physical sciences being transplanted into social sciences without really thinking through whether the assumptions that underpin it remain valid when considering social science research, especially qualitative, interpretive social science. Secondly this would either involve sharing the interview schedule etc which are already uploaded along with results to repositories like the UK Research Data Archive or it would involve writing up extra accounts of the research which is extra work on already time pressured researchers.

",,,,,Yes,Yes,Yes,Not applicable,Yes,Yes,Yes,"It will likely increase publication bias, as funding for publications is not available most of the time. I probably publish 3 papers for each one that was in a grant, so who pays for those to be published? No-one us going to pay up front. 

Secondly, it changes the incentives for the publishers, probably lowering the quality they would accept, seeing as they no-longer care if anyone reads it. ","Most of the data I use is confidential, so there are questions of anonymity. Loosening rules for access might reduce participants willingness to contribute. ","As above, reading other peoples code is time consuming and not very helpful. It is attractive to some personalities, as they like to think they could go through code and catch people out. In reality, having to get ones code into a publishable form is more work for no benefit. Probably for most analyses it is better if they are reproduced independently, not by just copying lots of someone elses code, with it's errors. Hard to see how this helps. ",,"One could imagins this undermines the business models of many journals, especially smaller ones to which libraries might not subscribe, and increases the stranglehold of larger, older journals. Not exactly an anti-trust measure. ","One downside is that it changes over time, and only ever gives more power to very 'stuck in a rut' types of thinking. Prospero used to take your protocol and publish it on their website. Now they 'review' it, which takes time, and decline to publish it unless you aquiesce to their changes. This is not the same thing as pre-registering, but it is what it has become, and probably an inevitable consequence of it. It is more work, as ever. 

When right heart catheterisation was invented, by a self administered procedure, there was probably no protocol registered. Who knows if someone so impetuous as to jam a catheter into their own right atrium and pulmonary vessels, for which they were fired, would have had the patience to fill out a form first? If their work had not been published as a result we would have lost this Nobel winning research. 

Another problem is that it is impossible to account for all the complexities of big data analyses until one sees the data (which one is not able to see until it is done). So one inevitably has to hedge the language of the protocol, which undermines the purpose of the thing in the first place. 

Another chilling effect of pre-registering is that people can register work, but not actually do it. No-one starts a review if there is already a protocol for it on Prospero, as they may be beaten to the punch, so it may mean the review is not ever done, or if it is done, means only one group does it. This is actually reducing reproduction of the science. ","Again, it's a lot of work. Much more than registering a protocol.

The attempt to apply data sharing policies from the world of large-N quantitative dataset to the field of qualitative/mixed-methods social science research is an utterly ridiculous proposition. The first thing we learn in qualitative research is the important of holism, contextualised analysis, and granularity in our data collection and analysis. In such a situation, I do not think that the practice of data sharing (e.g. anonymised interview transcripts that have been appropriately redacted to ensure participant anonymity) offer anything of value to a secondary researcher who has not personally collected the data and is thus unfamiliar with the broader context within which and purpose for which it was collected. No attempt to include 'metadata' can help solve this problem. ",,"See my comment above.

And while more availability is a good thing in principle and can do something to slightly level the playing field of scholarship between monied institutions vs independent scholars and those working in the developing world, there is no obvious burning need for work in (say) Sogdian philology to become available ASAP: it isn't going to save someone's life.",,,,,,,Considerably,Considerably,Considerably,Moderately,Slightly,Considerably,Slightly,Moderately,Moderately,Moderately,Slightly,Considerably,Slightly,Slightly,,,,,,,Moderately,Moderately,Considerably,Slightly,Not at all,Moderately,Not at all,Considerably,Considerably,Moderately,Slightly,Slightly,Slightly,Slightly,,,,,,,Written guidance only,Written guidance only,Written guidance only,Written guidance only,Written guidance and workshop-led training,Written guidance and workshop-led training,Written guidance only,Not sure,Not sure,Written guidance and workshop-led training,,,,,,,Useful,Essential,Useful,Useful,Useful,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,33359682

It is only fair to expect this if there are resources allocated to do so. Also a standard format/standard of what is ""raw data"" is needed. Lots of the programmes for acquiring data are not open access, and need paper lab books to interpret them. Is formatted analysed files in excel or similar format sufficient? Not strictly raw, but at least interpretable? We need directions from industry leaders to help us manage these expectations in a fair and efficient way",,,,,"For large-scale psychology/imaging/behavioural type experiments I can see why registered reports are an optimal way forward. However for more physiology/molecular biology type studies our experiments are sequential so it's impossible to predict all of the experiments and controls you need to run. Furthermore technology is ever advancing at a fast pace so you could get ""trapped"" using an out-dated methodology simply because you'd say you'd use it. More guidance from field leaders are needed to help guide the process because in principle it is a great idea, but practically I can't see how it will work for my experiments.

In order for this to be useful one would have to write a comprehensive guide to explain what each data file contains, how the data was recorded, whether there might be reasons the data should be ignored (e.g. something was misaligned) etc. This would take a person at least a month full-time to do. This is not a good use of time when precisely no-one will look at the data, especially if it is stored on a university-based server, rather than a server used by the international community.
It is also unclear what kind of data would ideally be stored. As I've indicated above, we record a large amount of data. However, this can often be reduced by a factor of 10 - 100 by suitable data processing and filtering. Is one expected to deposit all the original data, or just the data after processing? If the later, how much ""processing"" is acceptable?",,,,"In my field we have to apply for beam time at very large facilities. This involves getting the experiment approved by an access panel, stating clear objectives etc. However, when it comes to the experiment itself the reality is often rather different (things don't work, samples are not ready, the facility does not perform as it should, the proposed method is too difficult in practice, or the results look very different from expectations. In such cases -- which occur more often than not -- we have to follow our nose, and change the objectives and methods as the experiment progresses. It would be madness to do anything else -- and expensive too, when the experiments cost around £0.5M to run.","In addition to the points above, it would place an additional burden on our colleague to review the Registered report.

Communicating that preregistration is about transparency in analysis plans rather than about putting a ""straightjacket"" on research efforts is fundamental, in my opinion.

Making PhD theses open access, with no barriers to access (ie instantly downloadable) before they have been edited and peer reviewed as a book is detrimental for career prospects of junior academics and shortchanges the work. Open Access books are interesting but can only ever complement physical books, not replace them. It seems the funding, research excellence and OA regimes are pushing us away from writing and reading books, which will have detrimental effect on the very intellectual life we're supposed to be safeguarding via OA. Finally, unequal access to funds for OA worldwide means that it remains a highly inequitable option for academics from poorer institutions.","Ethnographic fieldnotes cannot in most cases be shared as an open access repository due to the complexity and local embeddedness of the material. Failure to understand these discipline-specific conditions of research make the push for open access data by funders and institutions problematic for qualitative social science, even if again it can bring marginal benefits to those who choose to go down this route - but it must remain voluntary.",,Similar as for data.,,,,Yes,Yes,Not applicable,Yes,No,Not sure,Not sure,"See above.
