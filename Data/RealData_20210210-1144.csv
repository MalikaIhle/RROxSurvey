Broadly, open research (also called ‘open scholarship’ or, in some disciplines, ‘open science’) refers to efforts to ensure that different elements of the research process are transparent and accessible. The aim of this survey is to assess the views of Oxford researchers on open research practices, related training needs and provision, and recruitment criteria.



The survey is administered by Reproducible Research Oxford. It is aimed at researchers in any role and at any career stage (including academics, research staff and fellows, research support staff, and postgraduate research students), working in any field of research across the collegiate University. The target audience includes researchers based in all Divisions of the University (Humanities; Mathematical, Physical, and Life Sciences; Medical Sciences; Social Sciences; Gardens, Libraries and Museums; Continuing Education) and/or in the Colleges.



Survey responses will inform the implementation of open research practices and responsible research assessment at Oxford. Therefore, it is important for all views to be represented. You are encouraged to take part whether or not you are aware of open research practices, and whether or not you deem them relevant or necessary for your field of research. Your participation will ensure that related guidance developed at departmental and/or University level is appropriate for your discipline.



As a ‘thank you’ for taking part, we will donate £1 to the University’s Coronavirus Hardship Fund for each survey submitted (up to a total of £1,500). Additionally, after completing the survey you can enter a raffle for a chance to win one of five £50 gift cards from Blackwell’s (optional; details below).



Survey procedure and data protection

Participation in the survey is voluntary. The survey comprises 12 questions, and we estimate that it will take under 20 minutes to complete. You can complete part of the survey and resume it on this device, using the same browser, within seven days. The survey will be active until 1st March 2021.



You can choose to exit the survey at any time. Additionally, you can explicitly request to withdraw your responses while the survey is active, whether you have completed it in full or only in part. Once you agree to participate, you will be provided with a respondent ID for this purpose (details below).



All responses will be anonymous and they will be used exclusively for academic purposes. Non-identifiable information will be shared openly in appropriate repositories, and relevant findings will be disseminated via the Reproducible Research Oxford website.



Once you complete the survey, you will be given access to a separate secure form. If you wish to enter the raffle for the Blackwell’s gift cards (optional), you can provide your contact details in this form. The information provided will not be linked to your survey responses in any way. It will be stored securely and permanently deleted once all raffle prizes are accepted. We will not use the information for any other purpose.



Reproducible Research Oxford is supported by an interdivisional award from the John Fell Fund (award number: 0007132). Ethical review of all procedures linked to the survey was conducted following Central University Research Ethics Committee (CUREC) guidance (approval number: SAME_C1A_20_105; contact: hod@anthro.ox.ac.uk), and in line with University guidance on the requirement of data protection law.

			In addition to the staff roles above, the survey is aimed at students on postgraduate research programmes (PGR, e.g. MSc by Research; MPhil; DPhil; EPSRC CDT; NERC DTP; BBSRC DTP; DClinPsych), not at undergraduate students, nor at postgraduate students on taught courses (PGT, e.g. MSc; MPhil; MSt; MLitt; PGDip; MBA; EMBA).",3. Please indicate the overall duration of your research experience (number of years rounded to the nearest 0.5 year).,"Page 3 | Open research practices 


This section focuses on open research. Definitions of relevant terms vary across fields of research and contexts. Therefore, we provide the following standardised entries for you to refer to throughout the remainder of the survey.

 

 
  
   
   
    Open Access publications An article, book chapter, book, or other scholarly work that is released with unrestricted access (i.e. available to the public to view online, or download, without registration, payment, or approval). This includes all forms of open access, such as 'green' (i.e. the accepted version of the work, after peer review, is shared by the author(s) in a repository), and 'gold' (i.e. the version processed by the publisher is released openly on the publisher’s system upon publication). 
    Repository A service dedicated to facilitating the preservation and sharing of research content, including digital repositories (for digital collections, data, code, etc.) and physical repositories (for collections, archives, reagents, specimens, etc.). The service may be operated by universities, governments, or private organizations, and it can be domain-agnostic or discipline-specific. Access to such repositories may be open or controlled (e.g. requiring registration, payment, or approval). Personal web-pages or other ad hoc methods of storing and sharing research content are not included.
    Data Any information underpinning a piece of research. The information can be qualitative (e.g. source, archive, representation of art, artefact) and/or quantitative (e.g. measurements, machine output, simulation results). The data can be raw (i.e. as collected), cleaned (i.e. corrected for errors), or prepared/processed (e.g. transformed into a different format for analysis, or anonymized for sharing). 
    Code Custom software developed by researchers specifically for the purpose of conducting a piece of research (e.g. a computer program to extract, clean, or analyse data, or to generate simulation results), or to build components of a research data infrastructure (e.g. a data repository). 
    Materials Any element of the research process that can be coded digitally or shared physically (e.g. protocols, survey questions, instructions, intervention materials, videos of the study procedure, specimens, reagents, samples, and other items used to collect data and/or conduct the research).
    Preprints An article, book chapter, book, or other scholarly work that is deposited in a repository ahead of peer review. Equivalent terms used in some disciplines are 'working papers' and 'unpublished manuscripts'.
    Preregistration The practice by which researchers specify elements of the planned work in a dedicated registry before observing the outcomes of the work. Examples include description of the planned approach for a qualitative study, and the data analysis plan for a quantitative study (i.e. a ’pre-analysis plan’, which can be submitted either before the start of data collection or for previously collected datasets, before the start of data analysis). 
    Registered report A journal article format in which research question(s) and methodology are peer-reviewed before the work is conducted. A submission may be provisionally accepted for publication following peer-review, and eventually published if the authors follow through with the methodology specified in the accepted version (deviations from the registered plan are allowed, but they must be explicitly justified and noted as such). Acceptance of the article to the journal is therefore independent of the results obtained. 
   
   
  
 




4. Which of the following research practices are you aware of, and which do you have experience with?
‘Aware only’ indicates that it is applicable to your discipline, but you do not have direct experience with it. ‘Accessing/using only’ refers to resources made available by others. ‘Practicing myself’ relates to implementation of the practice in your own research (in addition to, or instead of, accessing/using resources made available by others). - Open Access publication","Page 3 | Open research practices

Examples include description of the planned approach for a qualitative study, and the data analysis plan for a quantitative study (i.e. a ’pre-analysis plan’, which can be submitted either before the start of data collection or for previously collected datasets, before the start of data analysis). 
    Registered report A journal article format in which research question(s) and methodology are peer-reviewed before the work is conducted. A submission may be provisionally accepted for publication following peer-review, and eventually published if the authors follow through with the methodology specified in the accepted version (deviations from the registered plan are allowed, but they must be explicitly justified and noted as such). Acceptance of the article to the journal is therefore independent of the results obtained. 
   
   
  
 




4. Which of the following research practices are you aware of, and which do you have experience with?
‘Aware only’ indicates that it is applicable to your discipline, but you do not have direct experience with it. ‘Accessing/using only’ refers to resources made available by others. ‘Practicing myself’ relates to implementation of the practice in your own research (in addition to, or instead of, accessing/using resources made available by others). - Preregistration","Page 3 | Open research practices 


This section focuses on open research. Definitions of relevant terms vary across fields of research and contexts. Therefore, we provide the following standardised entries for you to refer to throughout the remainder of the survey.

 

 
  
   
   
    Open Access publications An article, book chapter, book, or other scholarly work that is released with unrestricted access (i.e. available to the public to view online, or download, without registration, payment, or approval). This includes all forms of open access, such as 'green' (i.e. the accepted version of the work, after peer review, is shared by the author(s) in a repository), and 'gold' (i.e. the version processed by the publisher is released openly on the publisher’s system upon publication). 
    Repository A service dedicated to facilitating the preservation and sharing of research content, including digital repositories (for digital collections, data, code, etc.) and physical repositories (for collections, archives, reagents, specimens, etc.). The service may be operated by universities, governments, or private organizations, and it can be domain-agnostic or discipline-specific. Access to such repositories may be open or controlled (e.g. requiring registration, payment, or approval). Personal web-pages or other ad hoc methods of storing and sharing research content are not included.
    Data Any information underpinning a piece of research. The information can be qualitative (e.g. source, archive, representation of art, artefact) and/or quantitative (e.g. measurements, machine output, simulation results). The data can be raw (i.e. as collected), cleaned (i.e. corrected for errors), or prepared/processed (e.g. transformed into a different format for analysis, or anonymized for sharing). 
    Code Custom software developed by researchers specifically for the purpose of conducting a piece of research (e.g. a computer program to extract, clean, or analyse data, or to generate simulation results), or to build components of a research data infrastructure (e.g. a data repository). 
    Materials Any element of the research process that can be coded digitally or shared physically (e.g. protocols, survey questions, instructions, intervention materials, videos of the study procedure, specimens, reagents, samples, and other items used to collect data and/or conduct the research).
    Preprints An article, book chapter, book, or other scholarly work that is deposited in a repository ahead of peer review. Equivalent terms used in some disciplines are 'working papers' and 'unpublished manuscripts'.

   Different factors may contribute to the adoption of open research practices, including:

   
    infrastructure, i.e. tools, resources, and/or services that enable implementation of the practice (e.g. repositories for digital or physical storage; registries for preregistration; publishing platforms or outlets) and of relevant community standards (e.g. guidelines relating to citation of data and metadata; ethical and legal guidelines for sharing sensitive data); 
    training, i.e the acquisition of knowledge and/or skills needed to implement the practice; 
    norms, i.e. widespread attitudes and behaviours that support and/or encourage the practice (e.g. the perception that the field is aware of the practice and in favour of implementation; interest from early-career researchers; support from supervisors, mentors);
    incentives, i.e. resources and/or mechanisms that reward the practice (e.g. dedicated funding, awards; institutional recognition); 
    policy, i.e. a requirement to implement the practice by relevant stakeholders (e.g. institutions, funders, publishers).
   

   
   Time may be perceived as an additional factor contributing to adoption of a practice. Rather, we consider availability of time, or lack thereof, as a consequence of the factors listed above. For example, a researcher may choose to invest the time required to adopt a practice depending on:

   
    the availability of infrastructure or training, which facilitate implementation;
    the existence of norms in the community, which mitigate the burden on the researcher;
    the presence of incentives, or policy, which reward and/or mandate the practice in the researcher’s field or institution.

   Different factors may contribute to the adoption of open research practices, including:

   
    infrastructure, i.e. tools, resources, and/or services that enable implementation of the practice (e.g. repositories for digital or physical storage; registries for preregistration; publishing platforms or outlets) and of relevant community standards (e.g. guidelines relating to citation of data and metadata; ethical and legal guidelines for sharing sensitive data); 
    training, i.e the acquisition of knowledge and/or skills needed to implement the practice; 
    norms, i.e. widespread attitudes and behaviours that support and/or encourage the practice (e.g. the perception that the field is aware of the practice and in favour of implementation; interest from early-career researchers; support from supervisors, mentors);
    incentives, i.e. resources and/or mechanisms that reward the practice (e.g. dedicated funding, awards; institutional recognition); 
    policy, i.e. a requirement to implement the practice by relevant stakeholders (e.g. institutions, funders, publishers).
   

   
   Time may be perceived as an additional factor contributing to adoption of a practice. Rather, we consider availability of time, or lack thereof, as a consequence of the factors listed above. For example, a researcher may choose to invest the time required to adopt a practice depending on:

   
    the availability of infrastructure or training, which facilitate implementation;
    the existence of norms in the community, which mitigate the burden on the researcher;
    the presence of incentives, or policy, which reward and/or mandate the practice in the researcher’s field or institution.

    the existence of norms in the community, which mitigate the burden on the researcher;
    the presence of incentives, or policy, which reward and/or mandate the practice in the researcher’s field or institution.
